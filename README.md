### Finding an idea

- [How To Decide What To Build](https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-build/), Daniel Gross (partner at Y Combinator).
- [Are you put off building something because it already exists?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19774997): a great discussion on HackerNews. \* "Next time you come up with that great idea, don’t Google it for a week. Let your mind fester on the idea, allow it to grow like many branches from a trunk."
- [Startup idea checklist](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html)
- [First Principles: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)
  - Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis.
  - A common way that people limit what’s possible is to tell themselves that all the good ideas are taken. Yet, people have been saying this for hundreds of years — literally — and companies keep starting and competing with different ideas, variations, and strategies.
  - The iPhone wasn’t first, it was better. Microsoft wasn’t the first to sell operating systems; it just had a better business model.
  - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. \* Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true.
- [Don’t think to write, write to think](https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/)

> As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
> — Harrington Emerson

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
> – Steve Jobs

### Funding

> Money is like gasoline on a road trip. You don't want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.

Tim O’Reilly, O’Reilly Media founder, and CEO

### Learning

> It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.
>
> – Elon Musk

### Meta: advice about advice

- [Most startup theory is ex-post, therefore bs](https://shafyy.com/post/startup-theory-ex-post/)
  - Do you think Musk copied that strategy from the business school he never went to? Do you think Brian Chesky of Airbnb heard that strategy from a friend?
  - The most satisfying thing about being an entrepreneur is that you can do what you think makes sense. That doesn’t mean don’t get advice. But get advice from people who know you, who you know, and most importantly, learn how to apply that advice.

> @awilkinson: "Here's the number I used to win the lottery" – Entrepreneurs giving advice

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- [Considering App vs. Website? Build a Website.](https://www.atrium.co/blog/founders-should-build-website-not-mobile-app/)
- [Avoiding The Wrong MVP Approach](https://medium.com/@jmspool/avoiding-the-wrong-mvp-approach-65fe3e5c5c28)
- [Signs You Aren't Really Building a Minimum Viable Product](http://www.panozzaj.com/blog/2012/01/11/signs-you-arent-really-building-a-minimum-viable-product/)
  - A MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers.
  - You should start with the riskiest assumptions that you can test and try to make them fail.
- A Smart Bear, [I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead.](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html)
  - MVPs are too M and almost never V.
  - An experiment should be Simple, Lovable and Complete.
- ["Sony was founded in 1946. Its first product was an electric rice cooker. Here are some early products from 11 other well known companies."](https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1563911769793478657)

> The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

> MVP, despite the name, is not about creating minimal products. If your goal is simply to scratch a clear itch or build something for a quick flip, you really don’t need the MVP. In fact, MVP is quite annoying, because it imposes extra overhead. We have to manage to learn something from our first product iteration. In a lot of cases, this requires a lot of energy invested in talking to customers or metrics and analytics.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

### Mindset

- [How To Be Successful](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful), Sam Altman
- [How to Be Great? Just Be Good, Repeatably](https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/)

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Theodore Roosevelt

  - Lucrative: Do they have substantial budget to solve this problem?
  - Liquid: Are they willing and able to buy right now?
  - Eager: Do they want to buy from you, specifically?
  - Enduring: Will they still be paying (or paying-it-forward) a year from now?

> If a person does not already believe they have a problem, they will not be surfing the Internet looking for a solution, and even if they happen upon your website somehow, you cannot get them to spend money to solve a problem they don't think they have.
