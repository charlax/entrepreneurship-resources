  - For any given company, the larger the company becomes, the more opportunities emerge to screw it up.
  - The more screwed up your company, the more people will complain about it and blame you.
  - The key to breaking the cycle is to stop feeling pressure and to start applying it. The most basic way to do this is to assign the problems to your team. This transfers the pressure from you to the organization and has the added benefit of empowering the team.

  - In contrast, the main app was plagued with bugs.
- [Before Growth](https://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth)
  - I think the right initial metric is ‚Äúdo any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?‚Äù
  - Until that‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes‚Äù, founders are generally better off focusing on this instead of a growth target.

### Founders

See also the section about CEO

- [What We Look for in Founders](http://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html), Paul Graham
  - Determination
  - Flexibility
  - Imagination
  - Naughtiness
  - Friendship
- [What we learned in studying the most effective founders](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/effective-founders-project/), Google

  - The key to scaling successfully for a product model company is to have strong, founder-mode leaders that work to develop other strong, founder-mode leaders.

### Finding an idea

- [How To Decide What To Build](https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-build/), Daniel Gross (partner at Y Combinator).
- [Are you put off building something because it already exists?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19774997): a great discussion on HackerNews. \* "Next time you come up with that great idea, don‚Äôt Google it for a week. Let your mind fester on the idea, allow it to grow like many branches from a trunk."
- [Startup idea checklist](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html)
- [First Principles: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)
  - Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis.
  - A common way that people limit what‚Äôs possible is to tell themselves that all the good ideas are taken. Yet, people have been saying this for hundreds of years ‚Äî literally ‚Äî and companies keep starting and competing with different ideas, variations, and strategies.
  - The iPhone wasn‚Äôt first, it was better. Microsoft wasn‚Äôt the first to sell operating systems; it just had a better business model.
  - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. \* Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don‚Äôt. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn‚Äôt true.
- [Don‚Äôt think to write, write to think](https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/)
- [Know Your Customers‚Äô ‚ÄúJobs to Be Done‚Äù](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done), HBR, Clayton M. Christensen
- [Creativity faucet: Increase your creativity](https://www.julian.com/blog/creativity-faucet)

> As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
> ‚Äî Harrington Emerson

> You can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something ‚Äî your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
> ‚Äì Steve Jobs

### Funding

- [Don‚Äôt Take VC Funding - It Will Destroy Your Company](https://www.eidel.io/2023/07/09/vc-funding/)

> Money is like gasoline on a road trip. You don't want to run out of gas on your trip, but you‚Äôre not doing a tour of gas stations.

- [Selecting the right product metrics](https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/), Jason Cohen
  - See example framework here: https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/007e7325.svg
  - A product sits in the middle of a chain of events. Start by plotting those events in time, by actor, and the so-called "value" we might measure
  - Distinguish between metrics you are satisficing ("guardrails", e.g., cost, uptime, MTTR, etc.) vs. maximizing (e.g., NPS, usage, DAU/WAU, features)
  - It can be a good idea to work on satisficing KPIs only when it slips in violation territory (e.g., outside of SLA error budget).
  - Putting metrics in context solves the debate between metrics that the team can impact immediately, and the one business stakeholders care about. Revenue remains (usually) the most important metric, but it's clearer that it can *lag* by a few weeks or months (Blackberry's revenue continued increased for two years after the iPhone launched).
  - A team must honestly and clearly measure *both* direct results *and* lagging outcomes. Not yet achieving the outcome is not a complete failure (luck is always involved), but a learning that will shape future work.
  - The diagram makes clear that there should be a balance between customer-visible work (creating value through new features) and invisible ones (tech debt, reliability, security).
  - If the customer‚Äôs business doesn‚Äôt thrive, they‚Äôll stop paying for your software, no matter how good the software is. While of course the customer‚Äôs business is again a multi-factor, lagging metric, where nearly all the factors are outside of your control, it‚Äôs still ultimately the greatest form of value. Even if you can‚Äôt control it, you can notice the attributes of customers who tend to thrive, and direct your marketing, sales, and features towards that subset of the market, yielding higher growth and retention, and likely higher profitability.

- [Signs You Aren't Really Building a Minimum Viable Product](http://www.panozzaj.com/blog/2012/01/11/signs-you-arent-really-building-a-minimum-viable-product/)
  - A MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers.
  - You should start with the riskiest assumptions that you can test and try to make them fail.
- A Smart Bear, [I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead.](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html)
  - MVPs are too M and almost never V.
  - An experiment should be Simple, Lovable and Complete.
- ["Sony was founded in 1946. Its first product was an electric rice cooker. Here are some early products from 11 other well known companies."](https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1563911769793478657)

> The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

> MVP, despite the name, is not about creating minimal products. If your goal is simply to scratch a clear itch or build something for a quick flip, you really don‚Äôt need the MVP. In fact, MVP is quite annoying, because it imposes extra overhead. We have to manage to learn something from our first product iteration. In a lot of cases, this requires a lot of energy invested in talking to customers or metrics and analytics.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
> ‚Äì Theodore Roosevelt

  - The means with which you pursue your goals are often just as important, if not more important, than the goal itself.

  - This is why it‚Äôs sometimes more valuable to fail at a goal than to succeed‚Äîthe failure teaches us what we should be pursuing instead.

  - Interdependency between parts requires the same organization to develop both components if it hopes to develop either component.
