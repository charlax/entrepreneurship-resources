> – G. K. Chesterton

### Focus

- [Why Evernote Failed to Realize Its Potential](https://nira.com/evernote-history/)

  - In contrast, the main app was plagued with bugs.
- [Before Growth](https://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth)
  - I think the right initial metric is “do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?”
  - Until that’s a “yes”, founders are generally better off focusing on this instead of a growth target.

### Founders

See also the section about CEO

- [What We Look for in Founders](http://www.paulgraham.com/founders.html), Paul Graham
  - Determination
  - Flexibility
  - Imagination
  - Naughtiness
  - Friendship
- [What we learned in studying the most effective founders](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/effective-founders-project/), Google

- [Coaching Founder Mode](https://www.svpg.com/coaching-founder-mode/), SVPG
  - Founder mode does not mean hands-off delegation, but it also does not mean micro-managing.  It is a manifestation of the passion for the customer and the problems to be solved, with the goal of collaborating closely with product teams to discover and deliver winning solutions.
  - The key to scaling successfully for a product model company is to have strong, founder-mode leaders that work to develop other strong, founder-mode leaders.

### Finding an idea

- [How To Decide What To Build](https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-build/), Daniel Gross (partner at Y Combinator).
- [Are you put off building something because it already exists?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19774997): a great discussion on HackerNews. \* "Next time you come up with that great idea, don’t Google it for a week. Let your mind fester on the idea, allow it to grow like many branches from a trunk."
- [Startup idea checklist](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html)
- [First Principles: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)
  - Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis.
  - A common way that people limit what’s possible is to tell themselves that all the good ideas are taken. Yet, people have been saying this for hundreds of years — literally — and companies keep starting and competing with different ideas, variations, and strategies.
  - The iPhone wasn’t first, it was better. Microsoft wasn’t the first to sell operating systems; it just had a better business model.
  - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. \* Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true.

- [Creativity faucet: Increase your creativity](https://www.julian.com/blog/creativity-faucet)

> As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
> — Harrington Emerson

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
> – Steve Jobs

### Funding

- [Don’t Take VC Funding - It Will Destroy Your Company](https://www.eidel.io/2023/07/09/vc-funding/)

> Money is like gasoline on a road trip. You don't want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.

Tim O’Reilly, O’Reilly Media founder, and CEO

### Learning

### Mental models

- [Second-Order Thinking: What Smart People Use to Outperform](https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/)

### Meta: advice about advice

- [Most startup theory is ex-post, therefore bs](https://shafyy.com/post/startup-theory-ex-post/)
  - Do you think Musk copied that strategy from the business school he never went to? Do you think Brian Chesky of Airbnb heard that strategy from a friend?
  - The most satisfying thing about being an entrepreneur is that you can do what you think makes sense. That doesn’t mean don’t get advice. But get advice from people who know you, who you know, and most importantly, learn how to apply that advice.

> @awilkinson: "Here's the number I used to win the lottery" – Entrepreneurs giving advice

### Metrics

- [Success & Velocity](https://breakingpoint.substack.com/p/success-and-velocity)
  - You need two kinds of metrics in your business: success and velocity.
  - Success metrics tell you whether you hit your goals
  - Velocity metrics tell you how likely you are to hit future goals
- [Selecting the right product metrics](https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/), Jason Cohen
  - See example framework here: https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-metrics/007e7325.svg
  - A product sits in the middle of a chain of events. Start by plotting those events in time, by actor, and the so-called "value" we might measure
  - Distinguish between metrics you are satisficing ("guardrails", e.g., cost, uptime, MTTR, etc.) vs. maximizing (e.g., NPS, usage, DAU/WAU, features)
  - It can be a good idea to work on satisficing KPIs only when it slips in violation territory (e.g., outside of SLA error budget).
  - Putting metrics in context solves the debate between metrics that the team can impact immediately, and the one business stakeholders care about. Revenue remains (usually) the most important metric, but it's clearer that it can *lag* by a few weeks or months (Blackberry's revenue continued increased for two years after the iPhone launched).
  - A team must honestly and clearly measure *both* direct results *and* lagging outcomes. Not yet achieving the outcome is not a complete failure (luck is always involved), but a learning that will shape future work.
  - The diagram makes clear that there should be a balance between customer-visible work (creating value through new features) and invisible ones (tech debt, reliability, security).
  - If the customer’s business doesn’t thrive, they’ll stop paying for your software, no matter how good the software is. While of course the customer’s business is again a multi-factor, lagging metric, where nearly all the factors are outside of your control, it’s still ultimately the greatest form of value. Even if you can’t control it, you can notice the attributes of customers who tend to thrive, and direct your marketing, sales, and features towards that subset of the market, yielding higher growth and retention, and likely higher profitability.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- [Signs You Aren't Really Building a Minimum Viable Product](http://www.panozzaj.com/blog/2012/01/11/signs-you-arent-really-building-a-minimum-viable-product/)
  - A MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers.
  - You should start with the riskiest assumptions that you can test and try to make them fail.
- A Smart Bear, [I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead.](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html)
  - MVPs are too M and almost never V.
  - An experiment should be Simple, Lovable and Complete.
- ["Sony was founded in 1946. Its first product was an electric rice cooker. Here are some early products from 11 other well known companies."](https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1563911769793478657)

> The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

> MVP, despite the name, is not about creating minimal products. If your goal is simply to scratch a clear itch or build something for a quick flip, you really don’t need the MVP. In fact, MVP is quite annoying, because it imposes extra overhead. We have to manage to learn something from our first product iteration. In a lot of cases, this requires a lot of energy invested in talking to customers or metrics and analytics.

-- Eric Ries, Lean Startup

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
> – Theodore Roosevelt

- [The Complete Guide to Goal Setting (Backed by Science)](https://markmanson.net/goal-setting), Mark Manson
  - The means with which you pursue your goals are often just as important, if not more important, than the goal itself.
  - A supposedly golden rule of goal setting is being able to measure progress towards your goal as precisely as possible. But it turns out the goals that are easiest to measure—external goals—are often the ones that bring us the least satisfaction.
  - This is why it’s sometimes more valuable to fail at a goal than to succeed—the failure teaches us what we should be pursuing instead.

- [Modularity Theory - Christensen Institute : Christensen Institute](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/interdependence-modularity/)
  - Modularity standardizes the way by which components fit together — physically, mechanically, chemically and so on. The parts fit and work together in well-understood, crisply codified ways.
  - Interdependency between parts requires the same organization to develop both components if it hopes to develop either component.

  - “MVPs” are too M to be V. They’re a selfish ploy, tricking people who thought they were customers into being alpha testers
  - A startup has to be so excellent at one or two key things, that they can screw up everything else up and not die.
  - If you have more than three priorities, you have none.
  - Your values are tested only when the decisions are tough
  - Pricing determines everything else
  - Price so that 100-200 [clients] is enough for all the founders to work full-time.
  - Early on, your job is to validate that there’s a business, not to validate that your idea is good or that a pain exists
  - People don’t value their time. They will do crazy things to save $2
  - If you can’t double your prices, you’re in a weak market position
  - A good strategy is to be the System of Record for something
  - It’s more powerful to be 10x better at one thing, then to shore up ten weaknesses.
